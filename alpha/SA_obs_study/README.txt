This Jupyter Notebook must be ran in the Quantopian's Research (their in-browser JN environment), which is linked below:

You may need an account to access the link above. If that doesn't work (I'd assume for security purposes), you can make an account of your own and copy and paste the code and it will work in their environment. They're really protective whenever it comes to importing and exporting files, so there are a lot of hurdles to overcome when dealing with their datasets.
